### About the Author

<blockquote style="color:#484848; font-size:18px;"><i>"Corresponding to the site title, I go by the pseudonym of "Slice".</i><br/>
<i>A Slice for your support. Life gets rough sometimes and it can be tough to get the support you need.  I just want to help people through my words.</i>
<br/><br/>
<i>Growing up, I did not have the emotional support and understanding I needed from the people around me. It was painful. Thankfully, through the supportive words of random strangers I encountered in life, I was able to heal and become stronger on my own. The enlightenment received made me realize that all I needed was myself. I want to spread the same support and message to more people. We don't need anyone else to always be by our side. We are fine on our own. Through the power of our minds.</i>

<i>Form your own Power, Be your own Slice of Power!"</i>  - Slice
