We tend to feel lonely when we have difficulty blending into the society, or when social norms do not line up with ours. When there is a lack of understanding and emotional support from people around us, the sense of loneliness can be immense and affect our daily lives.

Let Slice of Power be a supportive friend to comfort you in times of doubt and distress. To help you support yourself to the very end.


Words from the author:
I just want to help people through my words. Life gets rough and it is sometimes tough to get the support you need. Gorwing up, I did not receive emotional support I needed from people around me. It was painful. Thankfully, through the supportive words of random strangers I encountered in life, I was able to heal and become stronger on my own. They made me realize that all I needed was myself.

<p style="text-align:center;font-size:22px;">The key to anything is to love yourself first. You will always have yourself, you are 24/7 always there to support yourself, so love yourself first.</p>

Shine bright!





then let Slice of Power be your best friend/resource to help you through tough times. We all need a little support
