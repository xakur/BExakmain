Self-doubt is possibly one of the worst feelings one can experience. It can be very difficult to stay hopeful in times of doubt. The feeling of doubt usually stems from the lack of self-confidence, causing you to not believe in yourself. When you do not believe in yourself, the things that you are working hard for might suddenly seem pointless. It can become difficult to see hope in what you want to pursue.

<div style="align-text: center;">
<b>If you are feeling this way right now...</b>
<br/>
Pause all thoughts that are running through your head.
<br/>
Take a deep breath.
<br/>
Don't worry.
</div>

Rest assured that this is not an uncommon feeling and there is nothing wrong with you. You are not alone. It is okay to feel sad and hopeless in our journey at times. We are only human after all. In moments like this, it is important to be kinder than we normally are to ourselves.

We are all always learning to become better and stronger. Although this journey is not meant to be an easy one, you got this! Here are 5 ways on how to stay hopeful when you are feeling doubtful of yourself and your circumstances.

## 1. Pause and breathe - Take it easy

When feelings of self-doubt and sad feelings start crashing down on you, it can be difficult to think and act rationally. Pause whatever you are doing and take a few deep breaths. Breathe consciously. Focus only on your breathing.

Deep breathing helps to restore our calm quickly. Studies have shown that [slow, deep breathing can help to relieve the symptoms of anxiety.](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200303-why-slowing-your-breathing-helps-you-relax) 

If the feelings are overwhelming, drop whatever you are doing and give yourself some alone time to recharge. If you cannot do it right away (due to work, for example), stop whatever you are doing as soon as it is fine to do so. Permit yourself to rest and do nothing. Or do something else to take your mind off for the time being. Pause, step away from what you were doing and "reset" yourself.
