excerpt: Self-doubt is possibly one of the worst feelings one can experience. It can be very difficult to stay hopeful in times of doubt. The feeling of doubt usually stems from the lack of self-confidence, causing you to not believe in yourself. When you do not believe in yourself, the things that you are working hard for might suddenly seem pointless. It can become difficult to see hope in what you want to pursue.

<div style="text-align:center;"><b>If you are feeling this way right now...</b>
<br/>
Pause all thoughts that are running through your head.
<br/>
Take a deep breath. Don't worry.</div>
  
Rest assured that this is not an uncommon feeling and there is nothing wrong with you. You are not alone. It is okay to feel sad and hopeless in our journey at times. We are only human after all. In moments like this, it is important to [be kinder than we normally are to ourselves](https://sliceofpower.com/2022-12-19-be-kinder-to-yourself-when-you-feel-hopeless/).

We are all always learning to become better and stronger. Although this journey is not meant to be an easy one, you got this! Here are 5 ways on how to stay hopeful when you are feeling doubtful of yourself and your circumstances.

## 1. Pause and breathe - Take it easy

When feelings of self-doubt and sad feelings start crashing down on you, it can be difficult to think and act rationally. Pause whatever you are doing and take a few deep breaths. Breathe consciously. Focus only on your breathing.

Deep breathing helps to restore our calm quickly. Studies have shown that [slow, deep breathing can help to relieve the symptoms of anxiety.](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200303-why-slowing-your-breathing-helps-you-relax) 

If the feelings are overwhelming, drop whatever you are doing and give yourself some alone time to recharge. If you cannot do it right away (due to work, for example), stop whatever you are doing as soon as it is fine to do so. Permit yourself to rest and do nothing. Or do something else to take your mind off for the time being. Pause, step away from what you were doing and "reset" yourself.

Sleeping helps to keep my mind from thinking about an issue. Certainly, it is not always easy to fall asleep when you have a troubled mind. I would sometimes listen to soothing music and meditation tracks to help me shut my mind and go to sleep.

Another method that works for me is to pretend that I do not exist in this world. I will put my phone on silent mode and ignore everything. I would tell myself to lay down, sleep and pretend that I do not exist. Since I "do not exist" in that specific amount of time, nothing can bother my mind. I would normally wake up feeling refreshed and ready to deal with the issue.

<p style="padding:20px;font-size:20px;font-family:Tahoma;"><b>Sometimes, all we need is a moment of peace and quiet without any interruptions. Once you've regained your calm, take a moment to rethink the issue.</b></p>

Identify the source of your sadness and unpleasant feelings. Are you over-exerting yourself? Are you giving yourself enough time to work on it? Are you way too under-progress? If so, what's inhibiting you from being more active in what you want to do?

Take your time to think it through and craft a plan that works for you.

## 2. Avoid being too hard on yourself

You are making progress, so you are doing okay.

When chasing after a goal, we may sometimes become very anxious in our journey when we are very eager to reach our destination. We might become overly critical of ourselves along the way. We might get upset whenever we make a blunder. Hopelessness starts creeping in because we think we are falling short of ourselves.

Avoid beating yourself up over small mistakes or for taking longer than expected time to complete something. It is okay. It is normal and bound to happen. As you become more familiarized with the process, you will take a shorter time to complete the process next time.

<p style="padding:20px;font-size:20px;font-family:Tahoma;"><b>In times of doubt, do whatever it takes to keep you going.
<br/>Aim for progress, not perfection.
<br/>Any progress, as small as it may be, is good progress.</b></p>

Focus on moving forward first. Be patient. Perfecting it can come later. Just keep moving, you will get there.

## 3. Distract yourself

A distraction keeps you from being too emotionally invested in the issue and keep your mind off from the negative feelings. Some examples of distraction activities are going out for a walk, watching funny videos, trying a new recipe, talking to a friend, playing games, taking a good nap etc. Do whatever that works for you.

<p style="padding:20px;font-size:20px;font-family:Tahoma"><b>A change in environment and activities can shift your focus away from your worries or sadness that is causing the hopelessness.
<br/>Give yourself the time and space to stay away from what is bothering you.</b></p>

Depending on how you feel, you might not "be in the mood" to do something else or to stop thinking about the issue. However, you will need to push yourself to do it. Be kind to yourself. You deserve the time to break free from the issue for the time being. Recharge yourself.

Be away from your current situation for a couple of hours or even a few days. As much as possible, engage in relaxing activities that will not cause stress. You will return refreshed and ready, with more hope to continue your journey.

## 4. Be excited for what is to come

What are you working hard for? Visualize what there is to come once you have gained success. What are the merits of completing what you're working on? It will also be helpful to think of yourself as a successful person - you've worked hard for what you have today (the success that you currently have). So you are definitely capable of pushing through other challenges and rise to the next level.

<p style="padding:20px;font-size:20px;font-family:Tahoma"><b>Changing the way we think can help us change the way we see things. The things that you feel insecure about might not be so bad after all.</b></p>

Instead of feeling hopeless and anxious about what might happen, be excited about the challenges and end result. Welcome all challenges, for you have the ability to conquer them.

It is said that [anxiety and excitement are physiologically identical](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2021/04/07/anxiety-vs-relaxationrelabeling-anxiety-as-excitement/?sh=1ba767bc7afd), in terms of the physical sensations you feel when in either state. Both feelings trigger a sense of tension and anticipation. In times of doubt when you feel anxious about what there is to come, transform this thought into excitement instead.

![man excited about progress](https://images.pexels.com/photos/7567444/pexels-photo-7567444.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1)

[Research](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/xge-a0035325%20(2)_0287835d-9e25-4f92-9661-c5b54dbbcb39.pdf) has shown that transforming our anxiety into excitement can drive us to perform better. Use that adrenaline rush to your advantage. Reframe any negative thoughts into upbeat ones. Tell yourself and preferably, say out loud that you are excited. For example, "I'm excited about the success! I will keep going on to reach that success!"

Be excited for what there is to come and stay hopeful that good things will come your way. 

## 5. Reach out to someone or something that gives you hope

Some people might have their family and friends who serve as their pillar of support, readily available for them. However, for some of us, we have it tougher and need to form our own source of power. Our source of power does not have to be someone who is physically close to us. As long as it is someone or something that gives you hope, it is more than enough.

I am sure there are people in life, such as celebrities or influencers or other public figures whom you like and are inspiring to you. In fact, this does not have to be a person too. It can be anything - your favorite book, a well-produced video, your favorite song, your favorite quote and etc. Revisit an activity that makes you happy.

<p style="padding:20px;font-size:20px;font-family:Tahoma"><b>When feeling hopeless, reach out to your source of hope/comfort/positivity immediately. Do not be judgmental towards your own source of power. Be proud of your own strength.</b></p>

Remember, as "abnormal" or uncommon as it may be, what others think and our perception of how others feel do not contribute to our happiness. Spend some time with just you and your source of power to refill your positive energy.

In moments like this, I will push myself to listen to one of my favorite singers' songs. Some years ago, the singer once held a campaign, asking fans to create a playlist of their top 20 songs from their oeuvre on Spotify. It was a fun activity. I created the playlist and felt really empowered after that. Although I do not normally listen to the playlist (I like listening to a variety of singers), listening to this playlist whenever the feelings strike, will always comfort my soul and re-inject life into me.

During times like this, I think the tougher part is to be able to recall your source of hope and reach out to them immediately. It is easy to fall into a moody mode where your mind just wants to focus on the negative feelings. However, we have to pull ourselves up. Do not overthink and reach out right away.

## Conclusion

Do whatever it takes to help you stay hopeful and move forward. Remember to be kind to yourself and be patient with yourself. Believe in yourself that you know what to do. Do not be afraid to reach out to the person or thing that gives you the most hope and power. Affirm yourself that you will turn out fine, and your source (regardless of what it is) will definitely help you.
