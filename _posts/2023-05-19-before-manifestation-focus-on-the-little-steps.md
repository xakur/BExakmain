What does it take to manifest our goals? Why does the thought of having to manifest something feel like a tedious task? The idea of manifestation actually stresses me out a bit. There is too much emphasis on the destination and it makes me overthink and worry about whether I will succeed or not.

<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><b>I want to think about something simpler.</b></p>
<p>Instead of fantasizing about the big goal,</p>
<p><b>I want to think about the little steps that take us there.</b></p></div>

A long-term goal is made up of a series of short-term goals or rather, small tasks. To manifest your goals, it is important to be consistent in completing these small tasks that you need to do on a daily or regular basis.

Unfortunately, there may be factors along the way that stop us in our journey, e.g. we become unmotivated, we procrastinate or simply, we feel sad and cannot move on etc. The small tasks might seem dreadful and intimidating at times. 

<div class="box-purple" style="background-color:#fdfebc;">
<p>Hence, what's really important is to <b>focus on keeping up with these small tasks/little steps.</b></p>
<p>We need to <b>ensure</b> that these <b>small tasks give us continuing happiness</b>, so that we do not see these tasks as chores that we are obliged to do.</p>
<p><b>By being happy in the process, we can be consistent in our actions.</b></p>
</div>

Once you've become consistent, performing these tasks would eventually become a habit and part of your lifestyle. Here are 3 easy ways that can help you establish a consistent routine, so that you can hold yourself accountable in your journey.
