excerpt: People talk. It’s normal. Most conversations should be pretty normal and pleasant. However, we might hear something that does not sit well with us at times. Those words may bother us, and affect our mood for the rest of the day or even for days. Here are 5 tips on becoming unaffected by what others say. Everyone is entitled to say anything they want, and so is everyone entitled to choose what they want to listen to and accept.

People talk. It’s normal. Most conversations should be pretty normal and pleasant. However, we might hear something that does not sit well with us at times. Those words may bother us, and affect our mood for the rest of the day or even for days. Here are 5 tips on becoming unaffected by what others say. Everyone is entitled to say anything they want, and so is everyone entitled to choose what they want to listen to and accept.

If the words do not do us any good, we always have the choice to treat them lightly or even ignore them completely. You have the control. We hope that these 5 pointers will help build a stronger you, to become unaffected by what others say.

## 1. It's a reflection of themselves, not of you

When people are bad-mannered and say mean things, it is often a reflection of themselves and not of you. They are unhappy with themselves and are inflicting the pain on others, by making you feel bad about yourself. Unless you genuinely relate and agree to what they said (after seriously asking yourself about it), you should simply turn a deaf ear to those words. 

Truth is, what they think and say of you is none of your business. Their words and mind are theirs, you cannot control them. Likewise, your words and mind belong to you only. They cannot control how you feel. Only you can.

Often, people who do not mean well will be rude in their words and are out to offend you. There is no point to be upset over someone else's bitterness that is not related to you. On the other hand, people who mean well will be polite in their words and provide constructive comments to help you.

## 2. The words are not meant for you

Through my years of living on Earth, I have come to realize that in most situations, if you do not feel comfortable hearing someone else's words (be it positive or negative), then they are not meant for you. You have the choice to accept or reject it. Even for a positive message, if it was conveyed to you by the wrong person or at the wrong time, it is unlikely that you will pick it up immediately. That is totally fine.

If the message is meant for you, it will reappear at some point, through another person, or through a random encounter. After some time, you would have grown, matured and have the capacity to understand that very same message.

Therefore, if what someone said has made you uncomfortable, know that you have the right to ignore it too. It should not bother you since it does not speak to you.

## 3. Do not stoop to their level

If people choose to misunderstand you and say things to harm you, it is their problem. Not yours. They are not as mature and cultivated as you, why bother with them? If whatever they say lack substance, you do not have to accommodate to their level of maturity. Do not stoop to their level. Do not react or feel unhappy about it, simply because, they are not worth your attention.

You are stronger and more knowledgeable than them. You will not be affected by the nonsense.

## 4. The world moves on no matter what

Even if something bad was said to you, the world still moves on. We meet new things and new people as we grow. We have busy lives. More often than not, the people who said something unpleasant will forget what they have said too. If the remark does not resonate with you, it is useless. Drop it and move on. The others are going to continue living their lives. It will be silly to hold on to a useless remark.

Your life goes on too, no matter what people think or have commented of you. Only choose the words that benefit you and will push you forward in life.

Always stay in the present – whatever that was said, even if it happened just a second ago, it is already in the past. Ditch the words that are not relevant to you and continue on with your journey. There is no point to keep thinking about what is already over.

Make sure that you are doing the right things for yourself right now. You know what to do and you know why you are doing the things for yourself. That is the most important and nothing else matters.

## 5. Keep yourself in check

Another way to help you go unaffected by what others say is to have a mechanism in place to keep yourself in check. Find something that provides support to your values and can keep you calm. This can be a phrase from someone you admire, a person or a symbolic imagery and etc. Always bring it along with you in your heart wherever you go. When an unpleasant situation arises, remind yourself of that powerful phrase or thing that is in your heart, to help keep you in check and soothe your mind. 

**Ultimately, it’s what you choose to tell yourself. Other people are not you. Their thoughts do not contribute to your life at the end of the day.**

To help myself stay in the present constantly, I carry an image of an hourglass in my heart. An hourglass is indicative of the continuous passing of time and that our time will eventually run out.

Just like the the sand in the hourglass, we are losing time second by second. The bottom part of the hourglass represents the time that has already passed, and what is already gone. When I feel annoyed by a random past memory, I will consciously remind myself of the hourglass. It serves as a good reminder for me that I should focus on the upper part of the hourglass (the remaining time). I need to be in the present and do what is right for me. Time is precious. Do not let the detrimental words of others affect and waste your time too.

## Conclusion

Whatever people say, those thoughts will always be theirs. When you did not ask for anyone's opinion in the first place, whatever they said is based on their own accord. You have the freedom to ignore them. Since those words do not speak to you, they are not meant for you. They cannot affect you.

Listen to the wise words from people you look up to. Listen to whatever that helps you at the moment. Take in nurturing and inspiring words that can lead you forward. Take in the words that you need, in order to help you grow and become better.
