Habits, be it good or bad, are [learned behaviors or thought patterns that are formed out of frequent repetition](https://www.mindtools.com/aqscx1c/breaking-bad-habits). Although bad habits often provide instant gratification, they tend to bring about negative long term effects to our lives. Stopping bad habits is often not an easy task.

Surely, a bad habit did not just arise out of nowhere. If you look into the issue closely, our bad habits are usually triggered by our feelings. Yes, the trigger might be a physical event that had happened which could have led to a cause and effect, but it is ultimately the feelings that we hold towards the event that make us slip into our bad habits, **in order to seek comfort**.

The thrilling or soothing aspects of a bad habit often make us disregard the negatives of it. While our bad habits may bring us a certain degree of comfort, we would eventually realize that they cause us way more harm than good and we need to stop them. Here a few ways that I have found to be useful in stopping my bad habits and I hope they can help you too.

## Identify The Cause

Identify what is causing you to have the urge to do the bad habit. What’s triggering it? Sadness? Fatigue? Discomfort? Identify the root cause of the bad habit, and find an alternative to replace it, i.e. do something else.

The root cause can be an emotion or a physical problem that happened. Regardless, it is tied to how we feel - our feelings toward a problem. As much as we already consciously know that we need to break our bad habits, we sometimes slip into doing them once a certain feeling is triggered. The undesirable habit often serves as an instant relief to the sensation you are feeling, like a need to scratch an itch.

**When the urge to do the bad habit arises,**
- **Observe** what you are feeling  
- **Question** yourself – do you really need to do the bad habit to feel better?  
- **Think** about what other activities you can do to provide the same kind of relief and satisfaction

Ideally, note your feelings down on paper. Here's an example of what you can do:

<div class="box-success" style="background-color:#e3ffcf; border-left-color:#e3ffcf;">
[Example 1]
<br/><br/>
<b>Bad Habit:</b> Binge eating
<b>Cause:</b> Feeling sad or feeling bored
<b>What can you do instead? (Solution):</b> Do something else that you enjoy. Do something that takes away your sadness or boredom. E.g. play games, listen to music, watch funny videos, talk to a friend.
</div>

When doing an alternative activity to replace the bad habit, remember to: 

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Be focused on the activity only.</b>Do not do anything else.</p>

Treat yourself kindly. Give yourself all the time and space to do the activity that makes you happy. By focusing on something else, it will be easier for you to let go of the unwanted feelings, help you feel better and not think about the bad habit.

Our bad habits can come in various forms. For example, one of my bad habits is indecisiveness and here's what I did:

<div class="box-success" style="background-color:#e3ffcf; border-left-color:#e3ffcf;">
[Example 2]
<br/><br/>
<b>Bad Habit:</b> Indecisiveness
<b>Cause:</b> When making a decision, I'm able to see the pros and cons of all choices, making it hard for me to make a quick decision. The fact that there are too many angles to consider makes me uncomfortable -> Worry about making the wrong choice.
<b>What can you do instead? (Solution):</b> Instead of worrying over the consequences of not choosing either choices, I need to trust in myself that whichever decision I make will not go wrong. Regardless of what I chose in the end, it is out of a good intent and through very careful consideration. Therefore, I can feel safe to follow what my heart tells me to do.
</div>

This simple act of self-reflection can give us a clear idea of what the main problem is, especially in identifying the cause that is triggering the undesirable feelings. You can then find other ways to stop those feelings, instead of doing your bad habit to ease those feelings.

## Travel Back In Time - Replace current feelings with past happiness

This method may sound bizarre, but it always helps to alleviate my feelings and divert my attention away from doing a bad habit. Although we cannot physically travel back in time, we can always travel back in time with our minds. This method aims to help you re-experience the happiness and comfort you once had in the past. Let your mind go back to the time where you felt the happiest and most at ease.

This can be done through meditation or imagination. Alternatively, you can set the "past environment" for yourself by revisiting your past favorite activities, doing the things that you grew up doing, or by being in touch with the things you used to like (e.g. songs, movies, shows). **Our minds are powerful.** Transporting our minds back to our past selves can serve as a breather from the bothersome emotions that we presently hold.

Another approach to doing this is to travel back to the time __before you developed your bad habit__. Think about how you dealt with your emotions back then - You did not need to do the habit to feel okay, so why is it that you need it now?
