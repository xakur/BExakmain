Habits, be it good or bad, are [learned behaviors or thought patterns that are formed out of frequent repetition](https://www.mindtools.com/aqscx1c/breaking-bad-habits). Although bad habits often provide instant gratification, they tend to bring about negative long term effects to our lives. Stopping bad habits is often not an easy task.

Surely, a bad habit did not just arise out of nowhere. If you look into the issue closely, our bad habits are usually triggered by our feelings. Yes, the trigger might be a physical event that had happened which could have led to a cause and effect, but it is ultimately the feelings that we hold towards the event that make us slip into our bad habits, **in order to seek comfort**.

The thrilling or soothing aspects of a bad habit often make us disregard the negatives of it. While our bad habits may bring us a certain degree of comfort, we would eventually realize that they cause us way more harm than good and we need to stop them. Here a few ways that I have found to be useful in stopping my bad habits and I hope they can help you too.

## Identify The Cause

Identify what is causing you to have the urge to do the bad habit. What’s triggering it? Sadness? Fatigue? Discomfort? Identify the root cause of the bad habit, and find an alternative to replace it, i.e. do something else.

The root cause can be an emotion or a physical problem that happened. Regardless, it is tied to how we feel - our feelings toward a problem. As much as we already consciously know that we need to break our bad habits, we sometimes slip into doing them once a certain feeling is triggered. The undesirable habit often serves as an instant relief to the sensation you are feeling, like a need to scratch an itch.

**When the urge to do the bad habit arises,**
- **Observe** what you are feeling  
- **Question** yourself – do you really need to do the bad habit to feel better?  
- **Think** about what other activities you can do to provide the same kind of relief and satisfaction
