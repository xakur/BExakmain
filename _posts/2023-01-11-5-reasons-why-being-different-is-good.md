Previously, I shared about how being different is not necessarily a good thing. Being different in this world can at times be disheartening when you do not receive the support and understanding you need. However, these situations toughen you up and make you stronger than the average person. There will always be pros and cons to anything in life. We can make use of the downsides to our advantage. In this post, I will explain how and why being different is good.

I hope these reasons can provide some relief in your life as you try your best to live comfortably in this world. It is ok to not fit in completely, because someday, your uniqueness may inspire others and lead to a positive change in the society. Embrace your differences and have faith that it does you more good than harm as you live in this world.

## You have more empathy than others

Why? Because you do not receive the same kind of empathy as you give to others. The world works in favor of the majority. As the saying goes, "majority wins", most people will not attempt to understand you, or that it can be difficult for them to understand your point of view, when you belong to the minority. By being different, you know what is so-called "normal" and what is not. As such, you have a broader perspective of things, which makes you more knowledgeable than the average person. You are able to provide understanding to the "normal people", as well as empathize with people who are troubled by their own differences. You are able to be there for them. You know exactly how it feels. With your personal experiences and broad perspective, you are better able to show empathy towards different situations.

## You are creative

You do not follow the norm. You question the conventional things, and hence you’re able to make positive changes more effectively. You frequently have new ideas popping off your mind. It is not because conventional ideas are not good, but you naturally have the tendency to think deeper and to make improvisations out of existing ideas. When you are different, you look at things with a different perspective. Instead of whining about how the world is, you think about what changes can be done to make things better.

People who are different are creative and tend to have incredible ideas. If you think about it, the people who have made significant changes in the world are different. Be it through new inventions or fighting for human rights, they did something spectacular that nobody did. People might have condemned their ideas, thinking that they are strange and impossible, however, their success stories tell us that as long as you have a heart for the world and never stop being yourself, you can accomplish great things too. People who are different do not even have to try to stand out, because they are already born to be outstanding.

## More quality time to yourself

By being different, you are not easily influenced by what others do and like. You already have your well-established opinions. You are able to provide actual reasons on why you like or dislike something and that you will not just follow what other people think. For people like us, it can be surprising to know that [most people would rather follow the crowd than to think for themselves](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-do-people-follow-crowd-muhammad-salman). You have more quality time to yourself as your strong set of beliefs helps to keep you focused on what truly matters to you. Your uniqueness keeps you from being distracted and influenced by the norm.

## You mature early

Being different is not easy when people try to mold you into what they want. Through your own struggle of being different, you mature earlier than the rest. You have a tougher mind as you have already received plenty of generalized treatment, as well as the lack of empathy from others. You have to fight more than the others to prove your point or prove yourself. It is difficult for you to earn what you want. Despite so, it also means that your mind grows to become stronger and wiser. You pick up life lessons way earlier than your peers, allowing you to shine brighter in the later part of your life.

## You are more independent

In line with the previous point, as it is not easy to gain approval or something you want from others, you often have to look for your own resources, or even your source of comfort.

We have it a little tougher because we are different. The others may have difficulty in understanding you and your needs, and they might not bother to help you. However, in some cases, what other people can offer you may not be able to help you effectively. Gradually, you would realize that only you can give yourself the best advice and understanding you need. You grow to become more independent to help yourself with most things before approaching others. Be proud of your independence. Create your own path, find your sources of inspiration, enjoyment, and support. You know exactly who to learn from (e.g. someone you admire) and where to seek your joy.

## Conclusion

In the process of being different and finding out what works for you, you have trained yourself to be independent. You often have to rely on yourself to get things done, as well as giving yourself the emotional support that you need. **Well done on taking care of yourself and for staying strong.** Thank yourself for being true to yourself. You are capable of accomplishing big things and making breakthroughs, simply because you can see things differently that others cannot.

Although it may be tiring to live like an outsider in this world, remember that you are not alone and you are not the first person to experience these feelings. There are people who feel the same as you - **you have a community that you belong to.** We are all working hard in our own ways to live more comfortably each day. There is meaning behind your differences. You might not know it yet, but you will know it someday. Just be responsible for yourself and have a clear conscience in all that you do. You will be fine. Be different and be unafraid!
