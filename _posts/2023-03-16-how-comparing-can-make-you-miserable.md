Comparison is a pointless activity. People tend to compare a lot. Some people like to compare with the others to ensure that they are as good as them. When they fall short of the others, they might become sad, jealous and even start nitpicking the flaws of others. We are often advised against making comparisons in such scenarios.

Yet, on the other hand, when we are feeling negative about our situation, people sometimes try to console us and say that we are already lucky as compared to whoever, to make our negative situation appear happier than we think. (E.g. Someone may tell you, “Person X had to go through this or that, you didn’t! Count yourself lucky!”) However, truth is, regardless of the situation, comparing can make you miserable. This is because you are deciding if you are happy or not against someone else's life situation.

Often, people like to compare against the negative situations of other people to make themselves happy.

I do not think that is good either, because comparison amounts to nothing in the end. It is not practical to make a comparison in only one side of a matter or scenario. If you want to compare, both the negative and positive scenarios should be taken into consideration to make it a fair comparison.

Here is an example of what our thought process may be, when we compare against a...

<div class="flexbox-bord">
  <div style="background-color: #f9c9cf;"><p><b>Negative Situation:</b></p></div>
  <div>"The others are in a more negative situation than me. I am already very lucky. I will be happy with what I have, be happy with the situation that I am in, and not think that I need more."</div>
</div>

So with the same logic, when you compare against a positive situation, it should be...

<div class="flexbox-bord">
  <div style="background-color: #c0fcc1;"><p><b>Positive Situation:</b></p></div>
  <div>"The others are in a more positive situation than me. They are doing better. I'm not happy (enough) with the situation I am in. I need and deserve more. I want to become better!"</div>
</div>

Why do we need to compare with the negative situations of others in order to start feeling alright? If we want to compare, why are we not comparing against the positive situations as well? At the end of the day, <u>the act of comparing only leads to a clash of concepts</u>.

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Comparison in either way is pointless and unnecessary.</h3>

While it’s important to be grateful for all the good things you have in life, there should be no need for comparing to make you feel that way (become grateful).

When you compare, you are taking someone or something as a benchmark, to determine who is better or worse. It almost feels a little condescending as well, when you are comparing against someone who is worse than you to help you feel better. But this is just my opinion.

In my case, I realized that this mindset (comparing in this manner) had made me unintentionally neglect what happiness really meant to me, and had pulled me back from going after what truly satisfies my heart.

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Comparing makes you disregard your
<br/>true definition of happiness.</h3>

I felt miserable that day. It was as if I could not ask for more. I understand I need to be grateful and I am always grateful for whatever I have despite all the bad experiences I face. However, why did it feel wrong to want to get more?

I suddenly realized how obstructive this mindset can be. By thinking about how lucky I am as opposed to the sufferings of others, I started to feel that I was not worth the “better stuff” in life. I became too immersed in the life situations of others.

Thinking about people who were born into unfortunate situations and environments aches my heart (till today). I would start thinking that I am not worth what I have right now. It made me belittle my own suffering and sadness (unhappiness) instead. It became a rather toxic mindset despite it being out of empathy for others. I do truly care about the less fortunate in the world.

When you are already aware that you are not completely happy, comparing yourself to others and then deciding if you are happy or not can be rather stifling. It makes you suppress your true feelings, as you try to convince yourself that you are already happy, just because you are in a better place.

However, your happiness can only defined by you. It cannot be formed out of comparing to someone else’s lacks.

## Instead of comparing...
<br/>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>We should acknowledge our unhappiness.</b>
<br/><br/>AND
<br/><br/><b>Be brave</b> to pursue what we truly want.</p>

<div class="flexbox-bord" style="text-align:center;">
  <div style="flex-basis: 0; flex: 1;"><b>Be clear</b> of what your own happiness is.</div>
  <div style="flex-basis: 0; flex: 1;"><b>Avoid</b> letting <b>external factors</b> deny you of greater happiness.</div>
  <div style="flex-basis: 0; flex: 1;"><b>Decide</b> for yourself if you're <b>truly happy</b>, without comparing.</div>
</div>

Certainly, it is important to count your blessings. You can be grateful for the things you have but also, find ways to make yourself happier (if that’s what you truly want). It is also important to always have respect for others. However, don't become too immersed in the life situation of others, that you neglect what you truly want.

## If you're not happy with your life situation, TAKE ACTION.

I feel that we sometimes slip into being “lazy” or we lack the courage to go after our TRUE happiness after comparing to others (which in this case, comparing to those who have a tougher time than us).

For example, since we are already good and we feel adequately comfortable, we may keep the status quo. I think this is not a very helpful mindset, unless you are truly happy with the present circumstances, after much serious thought. We should not give in to our present comfort if we actually want something more in our hearts.

There are different ways to look at the current situation and determine what you want. Ultimately, it has to be through your heart – Are you truly happy? Will this happiness last for a long time?

<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
  <th>Comparing to someone who's worse than you</th>
  <th>Not comparing to anyone</th>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color:#ffffff">
  <td>- Feel that you are already good enough as compared to them, so it is ok.
  <br/>- Being satisfied with current state.</td>
  <td>- You know what you want. 
  <br/>- No external influences to tell you if you’re good/happy enough.
  <br/>- Focused on yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color:#fff4d1">
  <td>&#8594; In a way, this attitude is more <b>PASSIVE</b>, but it does not mean that it’s bad either. You are simply already happy with what you have, and do not necessarily have to do something more.</td>
  <td>&#8594; Pushes you to <b>ACTIVELY</b> do something; to keep grinding till you finally achieve what you want. You know you are capable of achieving more. Higher gains.</td>
</tr>
</table>

When you do not compare, you put all focus on yourself - to keep grinding and become better. You will know yourself better. If you are not truly happy with your current circumstances, you need to take action and make changes. If you do not do anything, no matter how much you compare to people, you will still be in the same spot and state of mind.

## Conclusion

In my opinion, comparison in general, whether for the better or worse, can make one feel empty. This is because you are using someone or something else as a benchmark to determine how you are feeling and even who you are. It keeps you away from focusing on yourself and building on your true happiness.

We are responsible for defining our own happiness. If you are not truly happy, it means you are not. There is no need to "find" someone else to make you feel better. Comparing is a never-ending chore. You can always do that for everything, and you may end up neglecting your true happiness. It is pointless to compare.

There are always things to be grateful for to make you feel better about your life, and this has nothing to do with comparing to someone else. Always be grateful and count your blessings. Be happy for the things and achievements that you have today. Whether big or small, be grateful for all the kindness that people have given you. Be grateful for the capability you have to accomplish all that you have today and never stop working towards a better you.
