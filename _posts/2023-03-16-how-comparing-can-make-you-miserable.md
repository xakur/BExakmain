Comparison is a pointless activity. People tend to compare a lot. Some people like to compare with the others to ensure that they are as good as them. When they fall short of the others, they might become sad, jealous and even start nitpicking the flaws of others. We are often advised against making comparisons in such scenarios.

Yet, on the other hand, when we are feeling negative about our situation, people sometimes try to console us and say that we are already lucky as compared to whoever, to make our negative situation appear happier than we think. (E.g. Someone may tell you, “Person X had to go through this or that, you didn’t! Count yourself lucky!”) However, truth is, regardless of the situation, comparing can make you miserable. This is because you are deciding if you are happy or not against someone else's life situation.

Often, people like to compare against the negative situations of other people to make themselves happy.

I do not think that is good either, because comparison amounts to nothing in the end. It is not practical to make a comparison in only one side of a matter or scenario. If you want to compare, both the negative and positive scenarios should be taken into consideration to make it a fair comparison.

<div class="flexbox-bord">
  <div><p><b>Negative Situation:</b></p></div>
  <div><p>"The others are in a more negative situation than me. I am already very lucky. I will be happy with what I have, be happy with the situation that I am in, and not think that I need more."</p></div>
</div>
