title: Being Vulnerable and Embracing Change
share-description: Any type of change will feel "out of place" at first. Even for a change that favors you. Give yourself enough time to adapt to the change without being critical of yourself. Prepare your heart for the change. Refrain from picking out things to disprove of the change.

excerpt: I find it interesting how a change of heart feels pretty much the same as the slight discomfort I felt after I got my back cracked at a chiropractor. It was not pain, and it certainly did not feel bad. It just did not feel “right”. It did not feel like it was in the right position, though the chiropractor’s job was to realign my bones and joints to make me feel physically better.

I find it interesting how a change of heart feels pretty much the same as the slight discomfort I felt after I got my back cracked at a chiropractor. It was not pain, and it certainly did not feel bad. It just did not feel “right”. It did not feel like it was in the right position, though the chiropractor’s job was to realign my bones and joints to make me feel physically better.

I'm not sure about other people, but I will normally feel weird for a couple of days after a chiropractic adjustment. This is typically due to how toxins are being released from the body. [It is said that the realignment of your body helps to open up blood flow again, which will allow the previously trapped toxins to be released](https://betterhealthalaska.com/chiropractor-anchorage/feeling-weird-due-to-toxic-release-after-chiropractic-adjustment/).

It's no wonder I'd always feel a little strange about my body after a chiropractic adjustment. The difference you feel after an adjustment, especially a physical one, would be noticeable. This is the same for a change of heart as well. In my case, being vulnerable to a friend and letting warmth into my heart.

## Story

Long story short, I decided to be vulnerable towards my friend one day.

It's not something that I usually do. If anything at all, I'm a pretty secretive and closed-off person towards most people. I don't share about myself, much less to talk about the pain and problems I face. I very much prefer to listen to what others have to say and ask about them.

It's not in me to talk about myself, but I suddenly decided to open up to this friend, when we were messaging each other. I told her

<div style="text-align:center;">
<p>how dark I am.</p>
<p>how broken I am.</p>
<p>my fears.</p>
<p>how I really am.</p>
</div>

It was a nerve-wrecking experience, and felt like a "make-or-break" situation. Considering how I was treated by former friends in the past, I was already expecting an outcome in my heart. I very well understood that no one likes to be around a negative person. By "negative", I mean a pessimistic or emotionally injured person, and not those who intentionally try to hurt others and spread negativity.

<div style="text-align:center; font-size:22px;">
<p>Being truthful can be agonizing.</p>
<p>I would rather not form any close ties to begin with. It would not hurt anyone.</p>
</div>

If I was lucky and if my friend was understanding, she wouldn't mind the broken me. However, there was also the possibility of losing this friend right away. She might leave me alone and never speak to me again. I wished I could be forthcoming with my feelings - to simply tell her that I do not want her to leave (the real) me. But who was I to request something? It did not sit well with me to ask a friend for help, even if all I needed was a listening ear or an understanding voice. But as we were getting closer, I wanted to reveal my true self before anything worse happens...

<div style="text-align:center; font-size:22px;"><p>A sort of fear arises in me when two hearts are getting closer.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7277896/pexels-photo-7277896.jpeg" alt="troubled lady sitting by the window" style="width:543px; height:358px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
  <p style="font-size:15px;"><i>What if they leave me once they know the real me? What if they start to dislike me once they know how dark I am? and etc.</i> Questions like these would often pop up in my mind whenever a casual bond was starting to form into a close one.</p>
</div>

A part of me very much wished for a positive outcome, but I was prepared for a cold reply or even no reply. As much as it would hurt for a while, I was prepared to let go.

<div style="text-align:center;">
<p>The moment of truth came.</p>
<p>To my surprise,</p>
<p>I was greeted with warmth.</p>
<p>And compassion.</p>
<p>And understanding.</p>
</div>

In fact, I was quite touched by what she wrote to me:

_"No, don't worry. I'm glad you're willing to open up to me. ...If you ever need to distance yourself for whatever reason, I completely understand. I will always care about you and always be your friend. Don't worry too much."_

I received what I was secretly hoping for without asking for it.

<div style="text-align:center; font-size:22px;">
<p>I felt relieved and warm in my heart.</p>
<p>Yet, I felt a little lost at the same time.</p>
</div>

My heart felt assured yet, it didn't feel "right" to feel assured. It feels as if it's not supposed to be that way. After all, it was a sensation that I hadn't felt in years. I chose to block those senses, since I've come to realize that revealing the real me will not result in a lasting friendship.

<div style="text-align:center; font-size:22px;">
<p>As opposed to receiving warmth and kindness and only to lose it later on again, I’d rather shut down these senses and let nothing in.</p></div>

Honestly, I don’t quite know what gave me the courage to be vulnerable and show her the real me either. I suppose, as our friendship was starting to flourish, the fear in me prompted me to be courageous and to be open towards my friend.

<div style="text-align:center; font-size:22px;">
<p>If I were to continue to hide myself, it would not lead to a meaningful connection - What's the point of this friendship then?</p></div>

## The Real Me?

Looking back at my relationships with people, even the ones before I faced the abandonment in life, I realized that I have always been a pretty secretive person all along. No one really knew the real me. I guess this makes sense since I wasn't sure of who I was back then either.

I just often see no need to show that side of me. Though, after all the heartbreaks, it certainly takes a lot more trust and observation before I reveal the real me. For the most part, I'm happy as long as the people around me are happy, regardless of how I present myself. I could be there for my friends, listen to their rants all day, spend time helping them to feel better, without talking about myself at all. It feels natural and am absolutely fine with that.

## Acknowledging and Embracing Change

I'm really thankful to this friend for giving me the assurance. It answered my fear. Although, the fear still lurks in my heart today (it isn't as strong now as before). I suppose, that's just my body and mind's way of protecting myself. I sometimes feel very bad and guilty for doubting the good intentions of my friend.

It even caused me to doubt myself too. Maybe I'm not good enough to receive the warmth? Maybe I'm not ready? Was I too quick in revealing the real side of me? If I wasn't ready yet, why did I do this to my friend?...

I realized that I was starting to find excuses to deny myself of the warmth. I found myself ridiculous. Did I want this or not? If I did not want this, I wouldn't have made this risky move of exposing myself to my friend. I realized, to fully embrace this warmth, I need to give myself more time and self-love.

<div style="text-align:center; font-size:22px;">
<p>I need to tell myself that I'm actually deserving of this positive change and warmth. I'm just doubting it due to my past experiences. I deserve this just as much as anyone else.</p></div>

When we are not fully accustomed to the new ways, it's easy to revert to our old ways or old mindset by accident. [Just like bad habits, the soothing aspect of it makes us fall back into old patterns, in order to feel safe and comfortable.](https://sliceofpower.com/2023-02-15-stopping-bad-habits-focus-on-your-feelings-first/) As much as we do not like the old ways, we slip into them because it feels familiar to us. It is normal and even inevitable for that to happen. Simply, changes take time to adapt to. This applies to all types of changes.

I gradually realized that it is okay to feel lost and "off" about the change in the beginning. There is no need to beat myself up over it and feel sorry towards my friend either. Moreover, an understanding friend would understand.

I have gained a <b>deeper</b> understanding about embracing changes in life.

<div style="text-align:center; font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;">
  <p>Any type of change will feel "out of place" at first.<br/>Even for a change that favors you.</p>
  <p>Prepare your heart for the change.</p>
  <p>Give yourself enough time to adapt to the change without being critical of yourself.</p>
  <p>Refrain from picking out things to disprove of the change.</p>
</div>

As I thought about this even more, I further speculated - why do I need her warmth and assurance to feel okay? Rather, why is there a need to believe it wholeheartedly in order to feel okay? I actually don't have to! Although I feel bad for doubting my friend, <b>I realized that I have to show myself more love as well</b>.

![woman hugging self](https://images.pexels.com/photos/5709914/pexels-photo-5709914.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=2)

Once I've developed a stronger love for myself, I would know that there's nothing to fear, for all I need is myself! I'm good enough for myself. On top of that, it's also important to be kind to others while loving oneself.

If trying to accept this warmth is causing too much discomfort, I can feel free to put it aside first. No need to blame myself. What I need to do is to work on myself; to develop more love within myself and know that **I'm worthy of the good things in life too.** I deserve these positive changes in my life. 

<div style="text-align:center; font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;">
  <p>I'm loveable, by myself and other people.</p>
  <p>A change is happening, so I need to be patient with myself.</p>
  <p>Give myself ample time to embrace this new change without guilt.</p>
</div>

Despite the varying emotions that the change has put me through, I am really appreciative of this very kind friend. After all, it must have been her vibe and demeanor that have made me feel safe enough to open up to her in the first place. She's been so kind to me all this while. I'm really thankful. I will cherish our friendship no matter what.
