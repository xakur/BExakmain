excerpt: I find it interesting how a change of heart feels pretty much the same as the slight discomfort I felt after I got my back cracked at a chiropractor. It was not pain, and it certainly did not feel bad. It just did not feel “right”. It did not feel like it was in the right position, though the chiropractor’s job was to realign my bones and joints to make me feel physically better.

I find it interesting how a change of heart feels pretty much the same as the slight discomfort I felt after I got my back cracked at a chiropractor. It was not pain, and it certainly did not feel bad. It just did not feel “right”. It did not feel like it was in the right position, though the chiropractor’s job was to realign my bones and joints to make me feel physically better.

I'm not sure about other people, but I will normally feel weird for a couple of days after a chiropractic adjustment. This is typically due to how toxins are being released from the body. [It is said that the realignment of your body helps to open up blood flow again, which will allow the previously trapped toxins to be released](https://betterhealthalaska.com/chiropractor-anchorage/feeling-weird-due-to-toxic-release-after-chiropractic-adjustment/).

It's no wonder I'd always feel a little strange about my body after a chiropractic adjustment. The difference you feel after an adjustment, especially a physical one, would be noticeable. This is the same for a change of heart as well. In my case, being vulnerable to a friend and letting warmth into my heart.

## Story

Long story short, I decided to be vulnerable towards my friend one day.

It's not something that I usually do. If anything at all, I'm a pretty secretive and closed-off person towards most people. I don't share about myself, much less to talk about the pain and problems I face. I very much prefer to listen to what others have to say and ask about them.

It's not in me to talk about myself, but I suddenly decided to open up to this friend, when we were texting each other. I told her

<div style="text-align:center;">
<p>how dark I am.</p>
<p>how broken I am.</p>
<p>my fears.</p>
<p>how I really am.</p>
</div>

It was a nerve-wrecking experience, and felt like a "make-or-break" situation. Considering how I was treated by former friends in the past, I was already expecting an outcome in my heart. I very well understood that no one likes to be around a negative person. By "negative", I mean a pessimistic or emotionally injured person, and not those who intentionally try to hurt others and spread negativity.

<div style="text-align:center; font-size:22px;">
<p>Being truthful can be agonizing.</p>
<p>I would rather not form any close ties to begin with. It would not hurt anyone.</p>
</div>

If I was lucky and if my friend was understanding, she wouldn't mind the broken me. However, there was also the possibility of losing this friend right away. She might leave me alone and never speak to me again. I wished I could be forthcoming with my feelings - to simply tell her that I do not want her to leave (the real) me. But who was I to request something? It did not sit well with me to ask a friend for help, even if all I needed was a listening ear or an understanding voice. But as we were getting closer, I wanted to reveal my true self before anything worse happens...

<div style="text-align:center; font-size:22px;">A sort of fear arises in me when two hearts are getting closer.</div>

  <p style="font-size:16px;"><i>What if they leave me once they know the real me? What if they start to dislike me once they know how dark I am? and etc.</i> Questions like these would often pop up in my mind whenever a casual bond was starting to form into a close one.</p>

A part of me very much wished for a positive outcome, but I was prepared for a cold reply or even no reply. As much as it would hurt for a while, I was prepared to let go.
