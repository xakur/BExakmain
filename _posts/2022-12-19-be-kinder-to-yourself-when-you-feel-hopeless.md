excerpt: Self-doubt is possibly one of the worst feelings one can experience. It can be very difficult to stay hopeful in times of doubt. The feeling of doubt usually stems from the lack of self-confidence, causing you to not believe in yourself. When you do not believe in yourself, the things that you are working hard for might suddenly seem pointless. It can become difficult to see hope in what you want to pursue.

Hopelessness is terrifying. When we start doubting ourselves, it seems that nothing good is going to happen no matter how hard we try. We doubt the purpose of our goal or dream and we doubt our abilities altogether. We lose a sense of hope in life. In times like this, remember to be kinder to yourself. Be kinder than usual.

I was feeling really overwhelmed the other day. Feeling a sense of hopelessness, tears rolled down my cheeks on their own and quite honestly, I did not know what to do about the situation. 

I managed to sleep it off, though with much difficulty.

I woke up the next day feeling slightly more refreshed. The bothersome feelings were still lingering in my heart. I got on with my morning routine and reflexively, I suddenly sat on the floor in my room. I was still feeling empty. I stared into blank space. My mind was quiet and empty. A few minutes later, something that my friend once told me suddenly trickled into my mind.

**_“Be as kind to yourself as you are to others.”_**

I thought it was amusing how out of all things, this particular sentence popped up in my mind. I thought it through for a minute - she is right.

I do not think of myself as a kind person or whatsoever, though I have been told this many times in my life. They might be right. I remember when I first heard this from my friend, I almost wanted to cry. It was not because I was happy or sad, but it was just a natural reaction. Perhaps my soul needed some comfort all this while. Perhaps I have unknowingly neglected myself.

My friend's words enlightened me.

I thought, if it were to be my friend feeling the same as what I was feeling in that moment,
I know I am going to:
comfort her
provide words of encouragement
show her how she is not a lost cause
show her that there’s still hope
