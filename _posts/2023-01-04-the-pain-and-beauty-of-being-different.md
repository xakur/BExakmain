title: The Pain and Beauty of Being Different
share-description: When we start doubting ourselves, it seems that nothing good will happen no matter how hard we try. We lose hope. Remember to be kinder to yourself than usual in times like this. Give yourself credit for all the little achievements you have made so far.

Many people only highlight the good side of being different. Now that I am going to openly talk rant about the pain of being different as well, does this make me even more different?

I will be honest, being different is hard in this world. It is not necessarily a good thing. Though, this applies to all things in life as well - there will always be pros and cons to anything. We should always try to look at the positive side of things (obviously right?).

As much as being different normally means that you are a pretty spectacular (inventive, creative) individual, I sometimes feel tired of being different as well.

## What it means to be different

We are all different and have our uniqueness anyway.

I would say, what's considered "common" is a collective reaction, one that is often taught to us by schools or parents, to react to certain situations.

As someone who is "different", I feel uncomfortable giving reactions that I apparently have to make. The typical reactions. This might sound weird, but I absolutely don't think there's a need to nod and show the speaker that you are listening during a presentation or when the speaker makes eye contact with you. I had to train myself to do that just because that's what I was taught to do. I suppose, it is also a way of showing politeness - to show the speaker that someone is listening. Till today, I will always feel a little weird whenever I nod to the speaker when listening to a presentation. It is not natural for me. I very much prefer to just sit and listen (and take notes if necessary). The information is all going into my head. I don't need to show it by purposely nodding!

When I was a kid, I remember having to "act" in certain ways just to show my parents or whoever around me that I acknowledged something, I liked something, I am displeased with something... I became fed up with it. One time, I purposely made an unhappy face while doing something that my mother demanded me to do. My mother automatically thought I was unhappy and told me off. I told her, no I am happy, I did that face on purpose to see if she would react negatively to it. She was speechless.

I dislike the fact that people are not asking people if they are ok, but are forming conclusions in their own heads, purely through reading facial expressions. If you are sensing some tension, shouldn't you ask the person first? Do not assume.

This is certainly one of the more uncommon examples on how I find "normal" behaviors odd. Perhaps due to the differences in personalities, likes and dislikes, I often find myself shocked at some of the things that people talk or think about. I definitely do not like that one trending pop song that I hear everywhere I go. I have my reasons.

Obviously, if I genuinely like a song, I will admit that I like it. But it just is so funny that most popular songs do not appeal to me. It can be that the melody is too boring, it sounds too common or vocals are so-so etc. When I ask people why they listen to a trending song, most of them will answer, "because it is the most popular song right now". Almost no one says that they like the song and even if they do, they can't explain why they like it too. It's weird to me.

Many times in my life, I find myself wondering, _“Why on earth do people like to ask about (certain topic)?”, “Why do people prioritize appearance so much?”, “Why do people only start liking a celebrity after they have become popular?”, “Why do people blindly follow the crowd just because someone said so?”_ and so on.

A lot of these questions pop up in my mind. I don’t do or think about what most people do, and hence I question their behavior. 

Yet, it turns out that I’m actually the weird one who holds different opinions. Turns out that I’m being overly harsh when I get annoyed when I spot basic grammatical errors in work emails – it looks unprofessional to me, but it apparently is common and can be let off.

**When you are different, it is normally like this - you either stand out or you get ostracized.**

It depends on whether your environment supports it. This environment can be your home, your workplace etc. It really can be anywhere. Whether you are ostracized or not depends on whether the people around you are supportive of your quirks and unique ideas.

I think each person’s growing up years play a very critical role in shaping character. It forms the foundation of us. If you land in a family who isn't understanding of your differences and tries to instill what they think is right on you, you tend to grow up having a hard time trying to be yourself and to be truly happy.

My family wasn't accepting of my quirks. I behave differently from my siblings and even my cousins. Among many other traits, they are more studious and obedient, while I am the playful one. My parents' way of parenting did not allow me to be me. Growing up, I felt awkward in my own body. It did not feel like I was living for myself and it was hard to be happy. I often felt drained and soulless. Fortunately, I managed to find myself again eventually. It took me many years to recover, as I had to relearn how to be comfortable with myself, heal from past hurts and live as myself again.

When we were young, we might had felt obliged to follow whatever the older ones had told us to do. It can be suppressing. Unfortunately, whatever that was said can follow us for many years into adulthood. I only hope that for those of us who are born to be different, we will all receive the enlightenment early on - to be brave to be who we are no matter what.

## Being different is a natural state

It can be painful when your differences are being condemned or ignored. On the flip side, it builds stronger resilience in us. When the world works in favor of how the majority flows, most people will not see the need to accommodate to your ways.

The odd ones have to work harder than the others to learn of what is normal, to accept what is normal, how to make compromises, face discrimination, and turn our differences into our advantage. We are using our brain a lot more as we are learning things in twofold and even more. We are smarter and we also have a higher tolerance threshold.

I resonate with what this author mentioned in her [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-being-different-awesome-elizabeth-pugel), where she is sometimes labeled as "being difficult" because her views are different. This has happened so many times in my life too. People may think that we are difficult, but we are just being precise because we have a clear end in mind. We very well know what is good and what is not for reaching a desired result.

When you are different, don’t expect people to accommodate to you. Don’t expect people to understand you. You are stronger than you know. You know how to face these "rejections" and you get better each time.

## Being different = More empathy?

I find that I am way more empathetic than others, and am always out to consider how others feel, precisely because I know how it feels to not be understood by others. Yet, when it comes to me, no one would show me the same kind of compassion that I show others. I felt very tired all of a sudden one day. Of course, I'm not saying that this is a definite case. It depends on your personality as well. I realized that I don't do a good job with taking care of myself.

Through my experiences, I've learned that if you’re naturally empathetic and giving, you need to prioritize taking care of yourself first, before others. This is even more important when you are also "different". The others will not take care of you as well as you take care of them. In some cases, they will not do a good job in taking care of you as your needs/beliefs are different.

I realized I’ve grown to become more independent than my peers as I often had to seek my own resolutions and source of comfort. Now, I naturally have a mindset to want to fix and do everything on my own.

## Being different as an advantage

As much as being different might bring us some inconveniences, I like to believe that we are the selected ones equipped with our uniqueness, because we are able to manage and shine through them.

Our differences (be it our mannerisms, thoughts or ways of doing things) might be frowned upon, but we can turn them into our advantage. The first step to turning our difference into our advantage is to embrace ourselves.

<p style="text-align:center;text-size:20px;">Accept yourself. Love yourself.
<br/>
Don't be judgmental to yourself.</p>

I understand this can be difficult sometimes, especially if you had grown up in a household that was not supportive of your differences. People might have made negative assumptions of you due to that. It’s important to remind yourself to love yourself.
