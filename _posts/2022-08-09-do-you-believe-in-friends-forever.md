I stopped believing in “friends forever” when I was 9. Not sure which sounds more absurd – the concept of “friends forever”? Or not buying this concept anymore at 9 years old. Most kids around this age are probably still unclear of the concept that people come and go eventually.

When we were young and clueless about the harsh realities of the world, we had probably subconsciously thought that things would stay as they are; the people we like will always stay as long as we maintain a good relationship. However, there are bound to be external factors that will challenge the relationships.

## Story

Here in where I live, through primary school (7-12y/o) and during my time (not sure if things are still the same now), students had to go through class streaming twice. Streaming is the process of grouping students into classes based on their academic capability. Here, students would be streamed to different classes, depending on their overall grades. Basically, all the smarties will be gathered in the same class (normally thefi rst class) while the average ones will be scattered through the remaining classes. There were 9 classes inevery cohort during my time. Due to streaming, most of your current classmates will not be in the same classas you for the next few years. You might be in the same class with a few of them when we go through streaming again, but it will only be a few.

Back then, I thought to myself… How was I going to keep in close touch with the good friends I had made? I’d certainly miss them… In the beginning of my new class in the new year, I missed my usual peeps. As time went by, the significance of them faded as I gradually got to know and befriended people in my new class.

Finding new friends in a new class may seem intimidating to some (especially if you are shy) at first, but ultimately, you are bound to meet new people that you can click well with. This continues on even after leaving school. True friends enrich the lives of one another.

Till this day, I vividly remember that day. After we were informed of our new classes, the cohort gathered at the school hall and we had to “reshuffle” ourselves to join our soon-to-be new classes and head to our new classroom. It was sort of like a trial. (It’s funny to think back about it now.)

As it was happening, I started thinking about the future… “This is only temporary. We are gonna be streamed and separated again in the next two years. How am I gonna maintain our friendships and keep close contactafter that?” Upon wondering about these questions, I realized that friends are not forever. I thought deeper about it… “After we graduate… or when I grow up and start working, we will all be going to different places. As much as I enjoy my current relationships with my peers, I need to know that such closeness will always be temporary. We won’t be as close as how we are in the future. Although true friends will certainly stay, no one can guarantee that it will be forever.” I concluded to myself that I should just live in the present and cherish the existing ties I have at any one point.

At that moment of epiphany, I thought to myself how naïve the term “friends forever” is. However, as I have grown older and witnessed more things in life, I also realized that it is not impossible to remain friends forever. However, how much does it take to have a friend forever?

I still do not have an answer.

I’ve certainly changed so much since decades ago. Things happened. Perspectives changed. We grow. It’s only natural.

I have always valued genuine friendships. I generally only consider a few people as my friends despite having a bunch of well-established relationships with my acquaintances. This is me and how I function in this world. Everyone is different.

## Conclusion

Some prosper with a big group of friends, some prefer to be alone (this is me too), some yearn to have many friends but seem to not be able to get one. No matter what you choose to be, it is all good. All you have to do is to let nature take its course and continue to be you. If you need to change your ways, the universe will surely find some way to let you know and push you to change. You may not know it but it will happen.

If you want to have friends, I would say, take it easy. No need to rush it. Sometimes, you are simply stuck in an environment (especially in the school context) where you cannot fi nd people of your kind. This happened tome too. You might feel lonely, but you are not going to be happy with the friends you make there if you forceyourself to “accommodate” to e.g. their ways, mindset, vibes etc. Change and accommodate if you are in desperate need for friends, ONLY if you truly want to.

I think what’s most important at the end of the day is to be comfortable with yourself and be happy to be alone. You are all you need.
