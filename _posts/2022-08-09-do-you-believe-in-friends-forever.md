I have stopped believing in “friends forever” since I was 9. Not sure which sounds more absurd – the concept of “friends forever”? Or not buying this concept anymore at 9 years old. Most kids around this age areprobably still unclear of the concept that people come and go eventually.

When we were young and clueless about the harsh realities of the world, we had probably subconsciously thought that things would stay as they are; the people we like will always stay as long as we maintain a goodrelationship. However, there are bound to be external factors that will challenge the relationships.

## Story

Here in where I live, through primary school (7-12y/o) and during my time (not sure if things are still thesame now), students had to go through class streaming twice. Streaming is the process of grouping studentsinto classes based on their academic capability. Here, students would be streamed to different classes,depending on their overall grades. Basically, all the smarties will be gathered in the same class (normally thefi rst class) while the average ones will be scattered through the remaining classes. There were 9 classes inevery cohort during my time. Due to streaming, most of your current classmates will not be in the same classas you for the next few years. You might be in the same class with a few of them when we go throughstreaming again, but it will only be a few.
