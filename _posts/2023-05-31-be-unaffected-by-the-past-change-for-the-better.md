Like fallen leaves, our past has left us. New leaves start growing and we create new memories, as well as change for the better.

Unfortunately, it can be tough to let go of the past completely. We might find ourselves restrained by our past at times. The events that happened in the past can still bring about influences today. We may hold grudges against someone or even ourselves.

The past might affect our behavior because it has more or less shaped us to be who we are today. Although this is normal, we must not cling on to the past and remain stagnant in our growth. As humans, we naturally strive to become better. As we change for the better in the process, we are changing from our old selves and distancing ourselves from our past. Everyone has to go through this as we are not perfect.

The key thing is to only take away the learning points from our past. Take away what's good for you. What lessons have you learnt from the past? What takeaways can help you in the future?

We need to let ourselves go by forgiving ourselves for our past. Things happened, and certain things were out of our control.

<div style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">
<p>Forgive yourself for your (bad) past.</p>
<p>It's normal for us to make mistakes in life and what is most important is to learn from our mistakes. </p>
</div>

Forgive the situation you were in and the past you had to go through. Know that it is all over now and your destiny lies in your hands.

## Why the past does not matter?

No matter how bad the past was, as long as you **focus on the present and keep moving forward, you are disconnecting yourself from the past, step by step**. Every single small step counts. 

You cannot rewrite or change the past, but you can write how you want your present situation to be. You are in control of your current direction, leading you to your desired future.

Even though the effects of what happened in the past might still influence you somehow, you can only **work on what you can do right now, to bring you further away from the past**.

You might have to work harder and spend more time than the others to undo all the damage, but such is life. There's no point comparing yourself to others either as everyone has each of their difficulties to go through. Our hardships are not comparable as we each have our own fate to go through. All we need to do is to focus on our paths, and be unaffected by what others say.

Even if people who were part of your past brings up the dark side, it will not affect you because you know you have changed. The current you is different. We are always learning something new as each day passes. We are always a little different from who we were yesterday.

The people you meet in the later part of your life would only know the current you. The you that you have established yourself to be. Even if they got to know your past, they would have already known that you are fine as you are through their interactions with you. The person that they like and want to be around with is who you are of the present day. 

People change all the time. As long as you are striving to change for the better, you are becoming a better self. There's no need to worry about how bad your past was since it is already over and there is nothing that you can do about it.
