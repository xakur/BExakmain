title: Be Unaffected by the Past. Change for the Better.
share-description: Comparison will stall your progress, as you are putting too much focus on others. Weâ€™re always changing. People only show what they want to show others. It is insubstantial to compare to what is only presented to us on the surface.

excerpt: We are often told not to compare ourselves to others, but we may still inevitably do it anyway. It is said that the act of comparing is a natural part of human cognition, which can be beneficial for the process of improving oneself. While it can feel normal to compare yourself to others, it is not ideal. Well, it depends on your attitude towards it.

Like fallen leaves, our past has left us. New leaves start growing and we create new memories, as well as change for the better.

Unfortunately, it can be tough to let go of the past completely. We might find ourselves restrained by our past at times. The events that happened in the past can still bring about influences today. We may hold grudges against someone or even ourselves.

The past might affect our behavior because it has more or less shaped us to be who we are today. Although this is normal, we must not cling on to the past and remain stagnant in our growth. As humans, we naturally strive to become better. As we change for the better in the process, we are changing from our old selves and distancing ourselves from our past. Everyone has to go through this as we are not perfect.

The key thing is to only take away the learning points from our past. Take away what's good for you. What lessons have you learnt from the past? What takeaways can help you in the future?

We need to let ourselves go by forgiving ourselves for our past. Things happened, and certain things were out of our control.

<div style="text-align:center; text-weight:bold;">
<p>Forgive yourself for your (bad) past.</p>
<p>It's normal for us to make mistakes in life and what is most important is to learn from our mistakes. </p>
</div>

Forgive the situation you were in and the past you had to go through. Know that it is all over now and your destiny lies in your hands.

## Why the past does not matter?

> No matter how bad the past was, as long as you focus on the present and keep moving forward, you are disconnecting yourself from the past, step by step. Every single small step counts.
