Negativity lurks around us - it is perfectly normal. We face troubles and have our fears. Not everyone is able to upkeep a positive spirit all the time, and it is understandable. We are only human. Dealing with negative people does not have to be a detrimental experience.

There is always more than one side to everything that exists. We all have our ups and downs in life yet, the downs are often being “judged”. Growing up, we were taught to avoid the negative and to only favor the positive. Negativity is always unwelcome and it is not without a reason.

What if your loved one has become negative? Are you going to avoid them? Are you going to leave them in the lurch and stop interacting with them just because of their negative energy?

Call me Alien? I am not one to avoid negative people immediately. Instead, I am rather interested in getting to know the cause of the problem through their life stories.

**NOTE:** By negative people here, I mean people who exude negative vibes through frequently complaining and ranting about their life. Not referring to those with ill-intentions or to bring you down (e.g. energy vampire). 

Each of us define ‘negative’ differently. People who have had good lives tend to have a lower threshold for negativity. Regardless, negative feelings do not appear for no apparent reason. Something must have happened. We probably need some time and/or techniques to process those feelings to regain our balance once again. 

It is totally okay to be in a negative state.

Anyone who has been there will certainly understand, and this is why I chose to be around this particular friend, who was constantly ranting about the downfalls of her life.

## Introduction

I met this friend online. We were able to hit it off really well in the beginning and we gradually became good friends.

After getting to know each other, we started talking about our lives and she shared about the events that happened in her life over the last few years. I shall not go into detail, but in short – she lost her job, her house and her partner. These events happened back to back.

I felt really sorry for what she had gone through and was thankful that she opened up to me. It certainly takes a great amount of trust to open up to someone (if the sufferings are genuine).

We hung out pretty often through voice calls. Time and again, she would rant about her past and grieve over what she had lost. She is not receiving adequate support from her family and is still having a tough time trying to regain her life. It made me sad to hear about it.

I very well understand how it feels to be at the lowest point in life – feeling helpless and hopeless. I did not want to back off and wanted to provide a listening ear.

As time went by however, the frequent rants had accumulated into a negative energy inside of me. It caused me to be moody, thinking negatively about things and even feeling hopeless at times, just by recalling our conversations at random times of the day.
I had not been a very positive person in my whole life. It took me years to understand that it is totally okay to feel what I felt, and to take time to let go of the negative emotions and past. I am still working on it everyday, to become a happier and better version of myself.

Unfortunately, the negativity I was receiving from my friend gradually drained my positive energy. At one point, I became irritable over little things and started feeling angry about my past (the issues that I already worked on and got over). I knew that something was amiss in me and I needed to do something about it.

**Takeaways of this Article:**

* Be prepared for some changes that may occur to you when you willingly decide to hang out with a friend who is going through a tough time, and is inevitably in a bad mental state
* Negativity may seep into you subconsciously and affect you later on, if you are not strong enough to support it
* **Take good care of yourself first before helping others**
* Ensure that you are mentally strong first before giving too much of yourself to help a negative person
* Ways to deal with the situation


I have always valued genuine friendships. I generally only consider a few people as my friends despite having a bunch of well-established relationships with my acquaintances. This is me and how I function in this world. Everyone is different.

## Conclusion

Some prosper with a big group of friends, some prefer to be alone (this is me too), some yearn to have many friends but seem to not be able to get one. No matter what you choose to be, it is all good. All you have to do is to let nature take its course and continue to be you. If you need to change your ways, the universe will surely find some way to let you know and push you to change. You may not know it but it will happen.

If you want to have friends, I would say, take it easy. No need to rush it. Sometimes, you are simply stuck in an environment (especially in the school context) where you cannot fi nd people of your kind. This happened tome too. You might feel lonely, but you are not going to be happy with the friends you make there if you forceyourself to “accommodate” to e.g. their ways, mindset, vibes etc. Change and accommodate if you are in desperate need for friends, ONLY if you truly want to.

I think what’s most important at the end of the day is to be comfortable with yourself and be happy to be alone. You are all you need.
