Negativity lurks around us - it is perfectly normal. We face troubles and have our fears. Not everyone is able to upkeep a positive spirit all the time, and it is understandable. We are only human. Dealing with negative people does not have to be a detrimental experience.

There is always more than one side to everything that exists. We all have our ups and downs in life yet, the downs are often being “judged”. Growing up, we were taught to avoid the negative and to only favor the positive. Negativity is always unwelcome and it is not without a reason.

What if your loved one has become negative? Are you going to avoid them? Are you going to leave them in the lurch and stop interacting with them just because of their negative energy?

Call me Alien? I am not one to avoid negative people immediately. Instead, I am rather interested in getting to know the cause of the problem through their life stories.

**NOTE:** By negative people here, I mean people who exude negative vibes through frequently complaining and ranting about their life. Not referring to those with ill-intentions or to bring you down (e.g. energy vampire). 

Each of us define ‘negative’ differently. People who have had good lives tend to have a lower threshold for negativity. Regardless, negative feelings do not appear for no apparent reason. Something must have happened. We probably need some time and/or techniques to process those feelings to regain our balance once again. 

It is totally okay to be in a negative state.

Anyone who has been there will certainly understand, and this is why I chose to be around this particular friend, who was constantly ranting about the downfalls of her life.

## Introduction

I met this friend online. We were able to hit it off really well in the beginning and we gradually became good friends.

After getting to know each other, we started talking about our lives and she shared about the events that happened in her life over the last few years. I shall not go into detail, but in short – she lost her job, her house and her partner. These events happened back to back.

I felt really sorry for what she had gone through and was thankful that she opened up to me. It certainly takes a great amount of trust to open up to someone (if the sufferings are genuine).

We hung out pretty often through voice calls. Time and again, she would rant about her past and grieve over what she had lost. She is not receiving adequate support from her family and is still having a tough time trying to regain her life. It made me sad to hear about it.

I very well understand how it feels to be at the lowest point in life – feeling helpless and hopeless. I did not want to back off and wanted to provide a listening ear.

As time went by however, the frequent rants had accumulated into a negative energy inside of me. It caused me to be moody, thinking negatively about things and even feeling hopeless at times, just by recalling our conversations at random times of the day.
I had not been a very positive person in my whole life. It took me years to understand that it is totally okay to feel what I felt, and to take time to let go of the negative emotions and past. I am still working on it everyday, to become a happier and better version of myself.

Unfortunately, the negativity I was receiving from my friend gradually drained my positive energy. At one point, I became irritable over little things and started feeling angry about my past (the issues that I already worked on and got over). I knew that something was amiss in me and I needed to do something about it.

**Takeaways of this Article:**
* Be prepared for some changes that may occur to you when you willingly decide to hang out with a friend who is going through a tough time, and is inevitably in a bad mental state
* Negativity may seep into you subconsciously and affect you later on, if you are not strong enough to support it
* **Take good care of yourself first before helping others**
* Ensure that you are mentally strong first before giving too much of yourself to help a negative person

## How Being Around a Negative Friend has Affected Me

| <span style="display: inline-block; width:200px">Before</span> | After |
|---|---|
| Was ON MY WAY to becoming a better version of myself; inspired and motivated | Felt completely drained and even hopeless about life; not as motivated as before after hearing my friend's stories |
| Had plans to do things and work towards an ideal future | The repetitive negative ramblings gave me negative feelings and made me worry about the future |
| Felt somewhat optimistic about life and wanted to move forward and stop dwelling on the past | As time went by, the repetition felt normal and it drew me into a state of negativity, causing me to feel sad about the past, again |
| Did not have unnecessary anxiety | Friend has anxiety and ADHD _(Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder)_. She is often aggressive in her words and often jumps from one topic to the other too. It gradually led me to feel anxious about my own pursuits and life |
| Always focused on doing one task at a time | My attention gets easily distorted |
| Had a stable routine in life that works for my health | Routine got disrupted and experienced relapse on certain health issues |

My time suffered, my mental health suffered, and even my physical health suffered.

It was really unfortunate that my physical health was affected as well. I had forgotten to take care of myself first. I was always prioritizing my friend's issues and rushing to her aid whenever she pinged me. I often worried about her due to her unpleasant state of life. I would find myself neglecting my own needs (and health) just to spend time with her to cheer her up.

It drained out all my positive energy gradually. Although I was not physically around her, the negative vibes could travel through the call! I could strongly feel how negative and unpleasant she and the overall atmosphere was. Whenever we ended our calls, I felt really drained and gloomy.

This may sound weird, given that they were just calls, however, the flow of energy can be felt.

I finally understood why we often hear people talking about staying away from negative people.

## Why did I stay on?

I used to be a very pessimistic person, so I completely understand how intense negative feelings can become. Of course, people whom I thought were good friends shunned me eventually when they realized how negative I can be. Mind you, I do not talk about my problems or reveal my true self to just anyone. It takes trust to show this side of me. 

Yet, people back off once they know how broken you are inside. People who cannot be bothered about the unglamorous part of your life will just drop you this line, "You are too negative." Okay, like duh?

When they started leaving, I told myself I do not want to be like them. I am not going to leave the "negative people" (as per how they said it) behind. In fact, we should really lend a hand when we see someone in need. No one wants to be negative. Sometimes, all it takes is to be a listening ear and be by their side.

I know how uplifting it can be when someone shows you compassion. I know how helpful supportive accompaniment can be - supportive of your situation AS WELL AS your emotions. I did not have these when I went through my phase.

As for this particular friend, my heart aches for her after knowing her story. I really wanted to be around to help her. Furthermore, she’s a genuinely nice person. She deserves the help and positivity.

I guess, a part of me had hoped that my positivity would influence her as well, to help her feel better.
Unfortunately, her current environmental circumstances had made it difficult for her to stay positive... As such, it feels like a never ending battle for me too. It is draining, but I genuinely care about her.

## How can we deal with this situation?

| <span style="display: inline-block; width:250px">If you're already affected by the negativity:</span> | If you're not affected by the negativity (Prevention):  |
|---|---|
| Jump out of it IMMEDIATELY | EVALUATE if you're taking care of yourself first |
| Stay away for a week or two. Take a break | Look for cues to understand if this person is genuine and trustworthy. Determine if they are worth your effort and time |
| Gently explain to them the worries/troubles that you’re facing and hence you have to spend lesser time with them etc. | Remember to keep yourself positive through your own means. Stay happy |
| **_If you don’t mind losing this person_** (after withstanding so much from them) and you are still unable to talk some sense into them, it might be good for you to vent your frustrations at them. They need to know too. If the person leaves, they are not worth your time and this can come to a complete stop. **_If they stay,_** this person is a genuine soul but is just broken in this period of time | If you're sensing that you're getting negatively affected, it is advisable to minimize contact for the time being. Stay away. Recharge yourself before hanging out with them again |
| Seek out your positive light/energy. Look for something that relaxes your mind; watching funny videos, reading, listening to music, meditation etc. | |
