We are often told not to compare ourselves to others, but we may still inevitably do it anyway. It is said that [the act of comparing is a natural part of human cognition, which can be beneficial for the process of improving oneself](https://wp.nyu.edu/mind/2021/02/27/why-do-we-compare-ourselves-to-others/). While it can feel normal to compare yourself to others, it is not ideal. Well, it depends on your attitude towards it.

When you see someone who is better than you, there are typically two ways to look at it: Are you acknowledging their merits and looking up to them? Or are you feeling jealous and unhappy that they are better than you? When I think about these two perspectives carefully, I realized that they are in fact, two very different concepts. In both scenarios, despite being aware of the differences present, the former is not based off a comparative mindset.

## Comparing VS Looking Up to Someone

Often, comparing ourselves to someone leads to negative feelings – we feel that we are not good enough. This typically arises out of low self-esteem. As we feel insecure about ourselves, we may get jealous of the others who have what we do not have, or who are what we are not. The others are better than you and you are unhappy about it. Perhaps you feel that they do not deserve it, or that you should be way ahead of them. Sometimes, you feel that you need to be the best.

From another perspective, looking up to someone is not quite the same as comparing yourself to others. When you look up to someone, you admire them for who they are as you see the positive points in them. You naturally acknowledge that they are better than you and you hope to achieve the same.

You are not putting yourself and the other party on a weighing scale to see who is "heavier" (better), but rather, you are only evaluating the differences between the two of you from an objective point of view. It is unlike a "comparison" where you are picking out differences and deciding who is better. It depends on your attitude at the end of the day.

Ideally, you need to accept yourself for who you are. Be satisfied with yourself, as you have your merits that are worth celebrating too. At the same time, it is important to constantly work on improving ourselves. Having someone to look up to can be healthy, when your figure of admiration acts as a motivating force for you to strive harder and achieve more. They serve as your role model as you would like to become as spectacular as them. This is vastly different from jealousy.

  <div style="padding-top:30px; padding-left:30px; padding-right:25px; padding-bottom:0px;"><p style="font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;">Comparison will stall your progress, as you are putting too much focus on others instead of yourself.</p>
  <p>You will never get anything done, if you constantly spend your time and energy comparing yourself to other people’s accomplishments. You should invest your energy in yourself instead - do something to help you get there (get to where you want).</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="imgtext-container" style="display: block; text-align:center; padding-top:40px; padding-left:40px; padding-right:40px; padding-bottom:10px; margin-bottom:40px;">
  <p style="font-size:21px; font-weight:bold;">Once you start comparing, it will be a never-ending chore.</p>
  <p>If you want to compare one part, you will also have to compare all other parts to make it a fair and well-founded comparison. It would not make sense to make a comparison in one area. We all have our merits and flaws. On the surface, we might think that someone is better than us, however, they are bound to have areas where they are weak in too. So even if we have a hard time in certain things and others do not seem to, they are bound to have a bad time in some other areas that we are fine with.</p>
  <p>We might not see it, but everyone has their own difficulties to go through. <b>With all sides considered, you would realize that the game of comparing is never-ending and it amounts to nothing at the end of the day.</b> You only have to work on yourself to become a better version of yourself. This has nothing to do with someone else.</p>
</div>

  <div style="padding-top:50px; padding-left:30px; padding-right:25px; padding-bottom:20px;"><p style="font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;">We’re always changing and evolving. This fact alone makes comparison a pointless activity.</p>
    <p>Why? Whatever you are comparing right now will become outdated and invalid in a few years’ or months’ or even days’ time. So why would it matter if someone is better with something at the moment? If you work hard, you will become better in no time. Who knows, at some point, the person might lose interest in something to pursue something else? <b>Things happen and change. The comparisons will become useless.</b></p>
    <p>In line with my previous point, once you start comparing, you will be comparing forever. As people change for the better, you will find the need to keep comparing with the renewed version of someone else. The conclusions drawn from previous comparisons would become irrelevant. <b>What’s the point of comparing when we are always striving to change for the better?</b> Focus on yourself.</p>    
  </div>

<div class="imgtext-container" style="display: block; text-align:center; padding-top:40px; padding-left:40px; padding-right:40px; padding-bottom:10px; margin-bottom:40px;">
  <p style="font-size:21px; font-weight:bold;">People typically only show the part of themselves that they want to show others. A comparison based on this is shallow.</p>
  <p>We may never get to see the negative side of a person. It is not often that we get to know the full story of what someone went through to achieve what they have now. <b>It is insubstantial to compare to what is only presented to us on the surface.</b> Once you get to know their hardships and the hard work they had put in, you will probably have a change in attitude. You may start to respect them instead. When you feel jealous of someone's achievements, ask yourself, would you want to go through what they went through to achieve the successes they have today?</p>

  <p style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;">Everyone is born to be different to begin with. No matter how much you compare, you are still uniquely you.</p>
  <p>We were all born into different environments, have different upbringing and different lives. As humans, we might go through the same emotions and/or similar experiences, but not everyone’s path will be the same. How we get from one point to the next will not be the same, because of differences in our environments, situations and personalities. It is what makes us unique in each of our own ways. Often, comparison makes us neglect our own uniqueness as we feel that we are not on par with someone else. <b>However, we are all different and are endowed with different talents.</b> The person you are comparing to may not have what you have. You just do not know it. <b>We all excel in different ways</b> and it is our uniqueness and different life stories that add color to this world.</p>
</div>

## Conclusion

Everyone is unique in their own ways. It is a waste of time to compare yourself with others as the time could be spent on improving yourself instead. Comparing can make you miserable. There is no need to be too focused on our lacks. We should embrace who we really are. When we see someone better than us, we can always take it as a learning opportunity to learn from them. To improve and become a better person, you should only compare yourself with yourself.

**Invest the time and energy in becoming a better version of yourself**. Forgive yourself for your past. Forgive the past that you had to go through, which might have caused you to become what you do not want to become. We all have our circumstances to go through and uncontrollable external factors may sometimes affect us in our journeys. No matter what, we need to believe that the time to shine will eventually arrive as we constantly strive to improve ourselves.
