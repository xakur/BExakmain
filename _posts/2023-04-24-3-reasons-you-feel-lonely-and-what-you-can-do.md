Loneliness is a universal human sensation. We have all felt lonely in our lives before. Sometimes, we may even feel lonely when we are surrounded by people. Our body may not feel lonely, but our heart does. For some people, it is both. Loneliness is unpleasant, but it is a sensation that everyone will go through in life. Periods of loneliness allow us to face ourselves, making us realize our true strengths and potential. It teaches us to be independent and emerge stronger.

Loneliness can be caused by various reasons such as the lack of meaningful relationships, feeling like you don't belong in the environment, social isolation, low self-esteem and etc. Ultimately, the root cause of loneliness often lies in how we feel about ourselves and perceive the situation. This article will go beyond and touch on 3 underlying reasons on why we feel lonely and how we can deal with it.

## 1. You don't feel loved

This usually stems from the feeling of no one understanding you and that you have no allies in this world. Sad to say, the root cause of this sensation is usually family or the environment you grew up in. We model after the behavior of our parents or people we grow up with. We give and receive love to and from our parents and family members. However, if you were born into a family where you do not feel loved (where you don’t have a sense of belonging especially), you will have difficulty feeling supported.

As love was not shown to you, you model after that sensation and apply it to yourself subconsciously; you feel that you are not worthy of love, you do not deserve love.

Consciously or subconsciously, you will always be trying to do something to earn the love that you want from your family or even from other people you meet in life. When people around you are unable to give you the love and support you need, it can make you feel lonely in this world.

In the process of finding and getting love from others, you may end up neglecting your own needs while you prioritize the needs of others instead (so you can make them happy and hopefully, receive love from them). There are all sorts of reasons behind why one would not feel loved, but the most important thing is to cultivate self-love.

## What can you do?

Ask yourself - Do you love yourself? If yes, what are you lacking? Focus on what is it that is making you feel lonely. It could be a lack of a significant partner, lack of friends etc. However, if you truly love yourself, you will come to realize that **all you need is yourself, so you are not truly lonely**. Only you are capable of bringing yourself the best happiness and comfort. It is what you tell yourself and how you work on yourself to make your soul happier in this world. If your happiness is always dependent on someone else, you are never truly living your life as your own. **Truly loving yourself should make you mentally self-sufficient**.

For some people however, you might still feel lonely despite already loving yourself. There are varying reasons behind that.

It might be that you feel the need to share a part of yourself with someone else or have someone around in order to fill a void in your heart. Ask yourself, why do you need someone around if you already love yourself so much? Because someone else's presence makes you happier? You need to think deep into the issue and fix it. True self-love will make you understand that you are not lonely.

On the other hand, if you don't love yourself, you will need to learn to love yourself first. [When you learn to love yourself, loneliness will no longer be daunting](https://thoughtcatalog.com/chelsea-leigh-trescott/2016/05/learn-to-love-yourself-and-loneliness-wont-be-something-youre-afraid-of/). For some people, it might not be as easy to love oneself. This might be due to personality, upbringing, home environment etc., but **an easy way to start loving yourself is to take care of yourself first**. Attend to yourself first by prioritizing your needs. It is important to be there for yourself by doing the things that you enjoy to show love to yourself.

If you dislike yourself, you are actually denying yourself all kinds of love to begin with. Once you've learnt to love yourself, you will also learn how to receive love and feel loved. Not only will your heart feel fulfilled, you will develop the capacity to receive love and warmth from others, for the act of loving yourself makes you recognize that you too, are lovable.

## 2. You haven't found your direction in life

Without a direction in life, whatever you do may feel unfulfilling to you. You might feel lonely, particularly when you see people around you have a goal that they are working towards and seem driven in life. You might feel that you are not good enough as compared to them, or that you are not doing the right things to make your life meaningful and make yourself happy. This may make you feel disconnected from others.

Not having a clear purpose or goal in life can cause a sense of emptiness, with nothing to anticipate. It may be hard for you to relate to others who have a goal to work towards and vice versa. This may lead to loneliness or isolation as you may feel embarrassed or dejected about your current state of life. Perhaps you may be scared of what others think of you, so you would rather isolate yourself.

Whichever reason it is, it is understandable to feel that way. It is not that you have no direction in life, you just simply have not found it, and that is okay.

## What can you do?

You will have to find something to fill the void - Find your purpose in life. You can do so by trying new things and **exploring new hobbies to see what aligns with your values and interests**.

Dive deep into who you are and learn about yourself. Reflect upon what activities can bring you happiness and fulfilment in your heart. Think about the excitement it brings you whenever you get to do those activities.

You can also make a mental note to yourself that you are not lonely, for you always have your favorite activity/activities to keep you company and happy. If those activities are starting to lose appeal, you can think about what more can you do to them to make it more exciting for you.

**Activities that make you happy surely bring significance to your life. Build on that**. Perhaps sharpening your skill in those activities can be something to look forward to. This can be applied to anything; gaming, cooking, drawing etc. Perhaps you want to reach a certain skill level and become better by a certain period of time. This can be your purpose in life each day. 

**It is meaningful as long as it helps you stay focused and motivated in life**.

You can also set short-term or long-term life goals for yourself - What do you want to achieve within the next 5 years? E.g. to be able to speak a foreign language fluently, to buy a new house etc. Plan what you are going to do to achieve them. No matter what, avoid being judgmental towards your own purpose in life.

## 3. You can’t find like-minded people around you

Personally, it is not easy to find like-minded people who can understand and accept my weird thoughts and beliefs. Even till today. 

Growing up, I never felt understood by my parents. I was/am still the oddball among my siblings, so I always had to do something more to fit in. [Being different can be a pain, especially when your differences are being ignored.](https://sliceofpower.com/2023-01-04-the-pain-and-beauty-of-being-different/) This had caused me to lose myself in the process.

Throughout my youth and young adulthood, I faced my challenges in isolation, never feeling like I had anyone I could truly confide in. The fact that I am an old soul makes things even harder. I do not think like how most people do. I tend to have a higher maturity in the way I behave and how I perceive things as compared to my peers. I am a deep thinker and looking at simple events often lead me to think of something bigger. I often cannot have intellectual conversations with my peers.

With the lack of a supportive community that understands you, it is very easy to feel lonely. There is no one whom you can share your joys and woes with, as they are not able to relate or might not be bothered to understand you. It is as if going through life struggles on your own. It can feel like a lonely battle.

## What can you do?

You pretty much have to be proactive in seeking out like-minded people. This is often easier said than done. However, with thanks to technology nowadays, we can easily reach out to people living in various parts of the world. It widens our social circle as we are able to extend our connections through online interactions, and get to know people from other places.

**With plenty of social media platforms available now, you can easily engage with others through a common interest**. E.g. chatting and making friends through livestreaming platforms, interacting with people who share similar interests on online forums or social media platforms.

Even if you cannot seem to find people similar to you in your environment (be it family, workplace or even country), there is bound to be someone out there in the world who understands what you are going through.

Let your mind be open to the world and equip yourself with more knowledge.

Generally, increasing the amount of reading can not only expand your knowledge base, but can also distract you from the loneliness that you are feeling as you become immersed in the reading. Reading up on other people's experiences, self-help books or other books and related articles may be able to relieve your mind.

All sorts of situations and emotions exist in this world. **Surely, there is definitely someone out there who have the same feelings (or even situations), and is able to support your beliefs.** They might be physically far away, but you are not alone. Find comfort in knowing that.

## Conclusion

To stop feeling lonely, learn to love yourself wholeheartedly. Seek the understanding you need from yourself first. Empathize with yourself with respect. Feel no shame in being lonely. Once you feel fully comfortable with yourself and when you know that all you need is yourself, you will never feel lonely again. 

You can find significance of your life from within. You are your own power. You have yourself to rely on, so you are never alone. Even if you feel lonely, be it in the physical or emotional context, there are still activities in life that you can engage in and find joy from.

When you look at things from a different perspective, you are not lonely after all. There are people out there who are going through or have gone through similar experiences and sensations. They would know exactly how you feel, and just like you, they are also coping in their own ways as best as possible.
